What can I do to assist you?\nUser: Bank stuff\nBanker:  Sure, let's talk about it here or somewhere private where we don't disturb others around us. So why did you want my assistance?\nUser: I want money \nBanker:  Oh that's no problem at all. If you're willing to pay for the service, then sure! Let me see how much would be appropriate...\nUser: Sure\nBanker:  Alright great! Now just tell me exactly what type of bank account you'd like opened up as well as any special requirements such as security codes or personal identification numbers (PINs)\nUser: im broke lol\nBanker:  Well there must be something else available to you if you're this desperate. Perhaps you could try getting part-time work while looking into alternative sources of income, maybe take online courses, etc.. It might not be easy but it'll give you time to think things through before jumping right back into debt.\n"
